## Application Overview

XcessCITY is a pioneering mobile application meticulously designed to bridge the digital gap among Selangor's citizens in this era of escalating smart cities worldwide. Our primary objective is to furnish a holistic solution, facilitating connections among Selangor's residents and contributing to the establishment of a smarter, safer, and more resilient Selangor.

XcessCITY offers a range of features to achieve this mission. Our cutting-edge live pothole detection feature ensures safer journeys for drivers in Selangor and contributes to the overall road infrastructure improvement. Simultaneously, the community forum creates a dynamic space for citizens to connect, share experiences, and exchange local news, fostering a sense of unity. Additionally, the discovery function enables users to explore nearby attractions, events, essential services, and trending activities, enhancing their daily lives and contributing to the city's vibrancy.

The technological foundation of XcessCITY is equally robust, utilizing Flutter for seamless front-end development and Cloud Firestore for a sturdy back-end architecture. Through strategic integration of APIs and external libraries, we enhance the user experience while optimizing costs. The application further harnesses the potential of machine learning by incorporating TensorFlow Lite, which seamlessly integrates with the live pothole detection feature, exemplifying our commitment to innovative solutions.
